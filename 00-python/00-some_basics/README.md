    In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess - The Zen of Python.

## Description of this Repository

This repository contains all the notes I have taken over the years while learning how to program in Python from various sources.

## An Introduction to the Python Programming Language

The programming language, Python was created in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum^[1] and was officially released in 1991. Today, it is one of the most popular programming languages^[2]^[3]^[4]^[5]

Python is a high-level^[6], interpreted^[7], general-purpose^[8] programming language and its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation^[9].

In Python, indentation is used to:

    * Indicate a block of code. 
    * Enforce readability.
    * Help keep code clean.
In programming languages like C, C++ & Java, braces are used to indicate a block of code.
Spaces are preferred over tabs.

Its core philosophy as summarized in the document ```The Zen of Python```^[10], includes aphorisms such as:

    * Beautiful is better than ugly.
    * Explicit is better than implicit.
    * Simple is better than complex.
    * Complex is better than complicated.
    * Flat is better than nested.
    * Sparse is better than dense.
    * Readability counts.
    * Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
    * Although practicality beats purity.
    * Errors should never pass silently.
    * Unless explicitly silenced.
    * In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
    * There should be one– and preferably only one –obvious way to do it.
    * Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
    * Now is better than never.
    * Although never is often better than right now.
    * If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
    * If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
    * Namespaces are one honking great idea – let's do more of those!
