/*
 * Variables are temporary containers for data in computer memory
*/

// BEFORE ES6
var name;
console.log(name)

// AFTER ES6 (BEST PRACTICE)
let secondName;
console.log(secondName)

// By Default, the value of all variables is "undefined"

// INITIALIZING VARIABLES
let thirdName = "Iano";
console.log(thirdName)
