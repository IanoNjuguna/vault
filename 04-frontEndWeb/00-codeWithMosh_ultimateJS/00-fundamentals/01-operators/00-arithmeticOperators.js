// Addition Operator
console.log(x + y);

// Subtraction Operator
console.log(x - y);

// Multiplication Operator
console.log(x * y);

// Division Operator
console.log(x / y);

// Modulo Operator
console.log(x % y);

// Exponentiation (Power Of) Operator
console.log(x ** y);

// Increment Operator
/*
 * ++x: 1 is added to x before the expression is evaluated.
 * x++: 1 is added to x after the expression is evaluated (You'll need a console.log statement after the evaluation to see the new value)
*/

// Decrement Operator: Similar to the increment operator (there's a difference between  ++x and x++)
console.log(--x);
